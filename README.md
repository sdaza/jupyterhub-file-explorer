#### Upload & Download Features

The extension supports multiple ways to transfer files:

1. **Manual Upload**:
   - Use toolbar buttons to upload to root directory
   - Use context menu on directories to upload into specific folders
   - Support for both individual files and entire folder structures

2. **Drag & Drop Upload**:
   - **Drag files or folders** from your operating system directly into the JupyterHub file explorer
   - Drop onto directories to upload into that specific directory
   - Drop onto empty space to upload to the current directory
   - Supports multiple files and nested folder structures

3. **Internal File Movement**:
   - **Drag and drop files and folders within the explorer** to move them between directories
   - Drag files from one folder and drop onto another folder to move them
   - Supports moving multiple files at once by selecting them and dragging
   - Prevents moving directories into themselves or their subdirectories
   - Real-time feedback for successful or failed move operations

4. **Download**:
   - Right-click any file and select "Download File"
   - Choose where to save the file on your local machine

#### File Creation Behavior

The extension provides two different ways to create files and folders:

1. **Toolbar Buttons** (View Title Bar): Always create in the **root directory**
   - Use these when you want to add items to the top level of your remote path
   
2. **Context Menu** (Right-click): Create **within the selected directory**
   - Right-click on any directory to create files/folders inside it
   - This allows you to organize your files in the proper subdirectories

#### File Editing

- **Double-click** or **single-click** any file to open it for editing
- **Save your changes** using `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+S` (Mac) to sync back to the remote Jupyter Server

## Configuration

Your server connections are stored in your VS Code settings. You can manage them through the extension's UI or edit your `settings.json` file directly for advanced configuration.

The configuration is stored under the `jupyterFileExplorer.connections` property:

```json
"jupyterFileExplorer.connections": [
    {
        "name": "My Dev Server",
        "url": "http://localhost:8888/",
        "token": "your-secret-token",
        "remotePath": "projects/"
    },
    {
        "name": "JupyterHub Production",
        "url": "https://my-jupyterhub.com/",
        "token": "another-token",
        "remotePath": "user/my-username/lab"
    }
]
```

### Connection Parameters

- **name**: A unique, descriptive name for your connection
- **url**: The base URL of your Jupyter Server or JupyterHub instance
- **token**: Your Jupyter authentication token
- **remotePath**: The remote directory path to browse (can be empty for root, or specify a subdirectory)

### Advanced Configuration Options

You can customize the extension's behavior through VS Code settings:

- **`jupyterFileExplorer.autoReconnect`** (default: `true`): Automatically attempt to reconnect when connection is lost
- **`jupyterFileExplorer.reconnectInterval`** (default: `5000`): Time in milliseconds between reconnection attempts  
- **`jupyterFileExplorer.maxReconnectAttempts`** (default: `3`): Maximum number of reconnection attempts before giving up
- **`jupyterFileExplorer.rememberLastDirectory`** (default: `true`): Remember the last opened directory for each connection

Example settings configuration:
```json
{
  "jupyterFileExplorer.autoReconnect": true,
  "jupyterFileExplorer.reconnectInterval": 3000,
  "jupyterFileExplorer.maxReconnectAttempts": 5,
  "jupyterFileExplorer.rememberLastDirectory": true
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Connection Failed**: Verify your server URL, token, and that the Jupyter Server is running
- **Files Not Loading**: Check your remote path and ensure you have proper permissions
- **Can't Create Files**: Ensure you have write permissions in the target directory
- **Can't Delete Non-Empty Folders**: The extension now supports recursive deletion of folders with files. If deletion fails:
  - Check the VS Code Developer Console for detailed error logs
  - Ensure you have proper permissions to delete all files in the folder
  - Some Jupyter servers may have restrictions on deleting certain system files or hidden files
  - Try deleting individual files first if the folder contains many items
- **Auto-reconnect Not Working**: Check that `jupyterFileExplorer.autoReconnect` is enabled in your settings
- **Directory Not Remembered**: Ensure `jupyterFileExplorer.rememberLastDirectory` is enabled in your settings
- **Drag & Drop Not Working**: 
  - **For external files**: Make sure you're dragging files/folders from your operating system file manager
  - **For internal moves**: Make sure you're dragging files/folders within the JupyterHub explorer tree view
  - Try dropping directly onto a directory in the tree view
  - If drag & drop fails, use the upload buttons for external files or rename operations for moves as alternatives
  - Check the VS Code Developer Console (Help â†’ Toggle Developer Tools) for debugging information
  - For internal moves, ensure you're not trying to move a directory into itself

### Auto-Reconnect Feature

The extension automatically attempts to reconnect when it detects connection issues such as:
- Network timeouts
- Server errors (500, 502, 503, 504)
- Authentication errors (401, 403)
- Connection refused errors

When auto-reconnect is triggered:
1. You'll see a notification about the reconnection attempt
2. The extension will retry up to the configured maximum attempts
3. If successful, you'll be notified and can continue working
4. If all attempts fail, you'll need to reconnect manually
